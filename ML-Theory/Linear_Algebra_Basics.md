# Linear Algebra Basics - Key Points

1. Vectors are arrows representing magnitude and direction
2. Matrix multiplication transforms vectors
3. Eigenvectors stay on the same line even after transformation
4. Eigenvalues represent how much an eigenvector stretches/shrinks
5. Tensors are generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions
6. Identity Matrix are used to initialize weights, for inverses, stability
7. Transpose of Matrix are needed for calculating gradients, symmetric operations
8. Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA) uses eignevectors to find directions of maximum variance
9. Spectral Clustering, covariance matrices, optimization techniques
